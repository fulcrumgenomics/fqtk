## Updating the README

The repository README contains a copy of the `fqtk demux` usage.
This usage must be manually kept in sync with the tool, and the project's GitHub Actions enforce synchronization between the two.

To refresh the README after updating the tool's arguments or docstring, run the included script:

```console
bash .github/scripts/update-docs.sh
```
